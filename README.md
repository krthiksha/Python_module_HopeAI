## Python Practice & Problem-Solving Exercises

During this learning phase, I strengthened my foundational knowledge of Python by completing multiple practice modules and hands-on exercises. My learning covered core programming concepts including:

- Print statements and basic syntax
- Variables and assignment operators
- Control structures (conditional statements)
- Looping constructs
- Functions and modular programming
- Data structures such as Lists, Dictionaries, and Sets along with their methods

In addition to conceptual learning, I completed three comprehensive problem sets that involved

* MCQ
* Coding and debugging challenges
* Scenario-based pseudocode development for given problem statements

These exercises significantly improved my hands-on coding skills and enhanced my analytical and problem-solving abilities. The structured practice helped me develop logical thinking and a stronger approach to writing efficient and scalable solutions.
